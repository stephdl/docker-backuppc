## About
This will build a Docker image for [BackupPC](https://backuppc.github.io/backuppc/) - A highly performant backup system.

## Maintainer
- [Dave Conroy](https://github.com/tiredofit)

# Table of Contents

- [Configuration](#configuration)
  - [Data-Volumes](#data-volumes)
  - [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
- [Networking](#networking)
- [Maintenance](#maintenance)
  - [Shell Access](#shell-access)

## Prerequisites and Assumptions
-  Assumes you are using some sort of SSL terminating reverse proxy such as:
   -  [Traefik](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-traefik)
   -  [Nginx](https://github.com/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager)
   -  [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)
- Make sure there is adequate storage available to perform deduplicated backups!


## Installation

### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build -t (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/backuppc) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull tiredofit/backuppc:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Container OS | Tag       |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Alpine       | `:latest` |

## Configuration


### Quick Start

- The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

- Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
- Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
- Enter inside the container and as user `backuppc` `ssh-copy-id` your public keys to a remote host
- Visit your Web interface

### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory           | Description                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/backuppc`     | Configuration Files                    |
| `/home/backuppc`    | Home Directory for Backuppc (SSH Keys) |
| `/var/lib/backuppc` | The backed up Data                     |
| `/www/logs`         | Logfiles for Nginx, BackupPC           |

### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) or [Debian Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/debian) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`, `nano`,`vim`.

Be sure to view the following repositories to understand all the customizable options:

| Image                                                  | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| [OS Base](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-alpine/) | Customized Image based on Alpine Linux |
| [Nginx](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-nginx/)    | Nginx webserver                        |

#### Container Options

| Variable         | Description                            | Default                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `USER_BACKUPPC`  | The uid for the backuppc user  | `1000`                 |
| `GROUP_BACKUPPC` | The gid for the backuppc user | `1000`                 |
| `CONFIG_PATH`    | BackupPC Configuration Files           | `/etc/backuppc`        |
| `DATA_PATH`      | BackupPC data backups                  | `/var/lib/backuppc`    |

| `SSH_KEYS_PATH`  | SSH Keys Path                          | `/home/.backuppc/.ssh` |


#### Authentication

By default, this image does not use authentication. This is definitely not recommended on a production environment! Based on the environment variables from the [Nginx Base Image](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-nginx/) you can set them here:

It's highly recommend you set at minimum:

```bash
NGINX_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE=BASIC
NGINX_AUTHENTICATION_BASIC_USER1=backuppc
NGINX_AUTHENTICATION_BASIC_PASS1=backuppc
```

| Parameter                                   | Description                                                                    | Default        |

`NGINX_AUTHENTICATION_LLNG_ATTRIBUTE1=HTTP_AUTH_USER,uid,upstream_http_uid` will get converted into `HTTP_AUTH_USER,$uid,$upstream_http_uid` and get placed in the appropriate areas in the configuration.
